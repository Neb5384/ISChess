#       Single important function is next_best
#           color: a single character str indicating the color represented by this bot ('w' for white)
#           board: a 2d matrix containing strings as a descriptors of the board '' means empty location "XC" means a piece represented by X of the color C is present there
#           budget: time budget allowed for this turn, the function must return a pair (xs,ys) --> (xd,yd) to indicate a piece at xs, ys moving to xd, yd

#   Be careful with modules to import from the root (don't forget the Bots.)
